# Pan India Consumer Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from the **Pan India Consumer Data**. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of consumer trends across different demographics and regions in India.

## Project Overview
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of consumer behavior, purchasing patterns, and demographic influences. The project involves:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends.
- Visualization of key insights.
- Statistical and predictive modeling to extract meaningful conclusions.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and duplicates.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Standardization and normalization of numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution analysis of consumer demographics.
   - Correlation analysis between various consumer attributes.
   - Trend identification across different regions.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Bar charts, histograms, and box plots for demographic insights.
   - Heatmaps for correlation between different variables.
   - Geographic distribution of consumer spending patterns.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
